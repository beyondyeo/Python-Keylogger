## Python Keylogger ðŸ”‘ðŸ“‹
A lightweight Python-based keylogger built using the pynput library to capture keyboard inputs in real-time. This project demonstrates how to log keystrokes while handling special keys like Backspace, Enter, and Space effectively. The keylogger writes inputs to a file for analysis, making it an educational tool for understanding keyboard event handling and logging in Python.
