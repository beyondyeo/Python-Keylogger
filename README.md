# Python Keylogger ðŸ”‘ðŸ“‹
A lightweight Python-based keylogger built using the pynput library to capture keyboard inputs in real-time. This project demonstrates how to log keystrokes while handling special keys like Shift, Enter, and Space effectively. The keylogger writes inputs to a file for analysis, making it an educational tool for understanding keyboard event handling and logging in Python.

## Code Files
main.py - Keyboard Listener (Tracks Keystrokes on runtime constantly)
keyboardController - Keyboard Controller (Controls Keyboard on runtime)
mouseController.py - Mouse Controller (Controls Mouse Positioning on runtime)
